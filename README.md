# gta_sa_exe-launcher
Basic Program to launch the original version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (v1) without having to add the game as a non-steam game. 
Once the game closes, you'll automatically leave the game on Steam. The Overlay does work.

Just build the program (or download the gta-sa.exe) and replace it with the one in your Steam folder. 
Afterwards, launch the game and enjoy.
